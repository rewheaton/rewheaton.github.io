### Machine Learning Bias
> What was the motivating factor or factors during the game which resulted in the integration of a Machine Learning model to evaluate job candidates through automated resume review?

The desire to hire faster in order to maintain funding levels seemed to be the motivating factor.

> What “good” situations existed in the game?

There were plenty of candidates, and they had varying levels of experience and skill.

> What “bad” situations existed in the game?

The lack of alternative hiring methods, such as working with a staffing or consulting company that could help vet candidates or provide an entire team for a project. The only tool available to evaluate the candidate was the resume, which isn't realistic. Interpersonal skills and references from existing employees would be useful additions to the process.

> How would you advise the business leader about when and how to implement a Machine Learning model to automate or improve the throughput of a hiring process?

I would advise rarely using a machine learning model for hiring, if ever. The liability it exposes a company to while limiting control does not seem to be worth the risk when compared to alternative methods like staffing companies, referrals, and increasing hiring throughput through temporary recruiters.
