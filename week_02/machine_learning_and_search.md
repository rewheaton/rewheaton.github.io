### Machine Learning and Search
Machine learning has the ability to vastly improve the relevancy of search results through personalization. Tools like [AWS Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) give organizations the ability to leverage their users' interaction history to tailor search results to be more relevant to a specific user. This will improve users' experience by reducing the amount of time spent looking for an answer. The primary ethical concern, of course, is the balance between providing relevant results and tipping toward privacy invasion. Especially in the healthcare sector, this could actually hurt the user experience if they feel the application knows _too much_ about them.
